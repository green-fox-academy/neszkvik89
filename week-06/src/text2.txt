Tyrannion Greek Τυραννίων Tyranníōn Latin Tyrannio fl 1st century BC was a Greek grammarian brought to Rome as a war captive and slave
Tyrannion was a native of Amisus in Pontus the son of Epicratides or according to some accounts of Corymbus He was a pupil of Hestiaeus of Amisus and was originally called Theophrastus but received from his instructor the name of Tyrannion "the tyrant" on account of his domineering behaviour to his fellow disciples He afterwards studied under Dionysius the Thracian at Rhodes
In 72 BC he was taken captive by Lucullus who carried him to Rome At the request of Lucius Licinius Murena Tyrannion was handed over to him upon which he emancipated him an act with which Plutarch finds fault1 as the emancipation involved a recognition of his having been a slave which does not seem to have been the light in which Lucullus regarded him
At Rome Tyrannion occupied himself in teaching He was also employed in arranging the library of Apellicon which Sulla brought to Rome2 Cicero employed him in a similar manner and speaks in the highest terms of the learning and ability which Tyrannion exhibited in these labours3 Cicero also availed himself of his services in the instruction of his nephew Quintus4 Strabo speaks of having received instruction from Tyrannion5
The geographical knowledge of Tyrannion seems to have been considerable at any rate Cicero thought highly of it6 Tyrannion amassed considerable wealth and according to the scarcely credible statement of the Suda7 collected himself a library of 30000 volumes Cicero alludes to a small work of his8 but we do not learn the subject of it Tyrannion died at a very advanced age of a paralytic stroke
